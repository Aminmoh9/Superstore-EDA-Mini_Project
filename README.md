# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Superstore Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Superstore dataset** using R. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights through visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Business Questions Addressed

### 1. **How does sales performance vary over time?**
   - Identified monthly trends and seasonal patterns.
   - Analyzed peak sales months and unusual dips.
   - (Optional) Calculated Year-over-Year (YOY) growth.
   - Suggested potential reasons for seasonal variations.

### 2. **Which product categories have the best/worst profit margins?**
   - Identified the category with the thinnest profit margins.
   - Compared profit margin differences between top and bottom categories.
   - Proposed strategies to improve low-performing categories.

### 3. **How do regional performances compare?**
   - Identified regions with high sales and high profitability.
   - Found regions with negative profits.
   - Analyzed the correlation between high sales and high profits.
   - Suggested region-specific business strategies.

### 4. **What does customer segmentation reveal?**
   - Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
   - Identified revenue contributions by customer segment.
   - Proposed retention strategies for "At Risk" customers.
   - Recommended marketing approaches for "High Spenders."

### 5. **How does shipping mode affect profitability?**
   - Compared profit margins across shipping modes.
   - Calculated profit per order by shipping method.
   - Suggested an optimal shipping strategy based on findings.

## Extra Analysis
- Provided **3 actionable business recommendations** based on EDA findings.
- Proposed **2 additional questions** for deeper analysis.
- Estimated the **potential financial impact** of recommendations.

## Discussion Points
- Correlation between **sales trends and marketing initiatives**.
- Regional preferences for **product categories**.
- Operational changes to improve **low-margin categories**.
- Influence of **customer segmentation on inventory management**.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** R
- **Libraries:** ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, tidyr, and other tidyverse packages
- **Visualization Tools:** ggplot2, plotly
- **Statistical Methods:** RFM Analysis, YOY Growth Rate, Profit Margin Analysis

## Deliverables
- A complete **R Notebook** (or file) containing all analyses and visualizations.
- Clear documentation of insights and business recommendations.

## Submission Instructions
1. **Add the completed notebook to Git.**
2. **Commit and push your branch to the remote repository.**
3. **Create a pull request (PR).**
4. **Paste the PR link in the Student Portal.**
